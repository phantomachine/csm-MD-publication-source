\begin_layout Abstract
\paragraph_spacing single
\noindent
We study long-run inflation in a competitive-search model with heterogeneous agents.
 Under competitive search,
 individuals' matching-probability (extensive) margins trade off against quantity (intensive) margins.
 With money and unfettered market participation,
 these trade-offs depend on inflation and individuals' heterogeneous money holdings.
 We find that welfare falls as inflation increases.
 However,
 money-holdings inequality is not monotonic in inflation.
 As inflation rises,
 liquid-wealth inequality first falls.
 For sufficiently high inflation,
 the overall extensive-margin effect dominates the intensive margin,
 and liquid-wealth inequality rises.
 The model also poses a new computational challenge to which we propose a novel solution method.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We study the effects of long-run inflation in a model with competitive search and non-degenerate money distribution.
 Monetary search models provide a deeper microfoundation of money,
 where important market frictions or behavioral outcomes are not assumed but are consequences of environmental (e.g.,
 informational and contractual) imperfections.
 The framework has been applied to answer many questions such as the existence and essentiality of money,
 financial intermediation,
 asset liquidity,
 and equilibrium price dispersion.

In this paper,
 we follow and extend the model of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 to study non-zero inflation.
 The heterogeneity in our model is a result of equilibrium directed search and matching frictions.
 That is,
 we do not rely on exogenous shocks to individual states,
 and,
 as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

,
 possible persistence in agent heterogeneity is induced by endogenous individual spending cycles.

This is an alternative to Bewley-style models where the fundamental source of agent heterogeneity is exogenous and comes from random income or taste shocks.
 Earlier Bewley-style monetary models use a cash-in-advance assumption

 Extensions of Bewley-style models include the recent literature on HANK models.
 These are non-monetary models where sticky-price assumptions deliver monetary policy consequences

 In such models,
 the shocks are assumed to be persistent.
 This induces additional,
 if not most of the,
 persistent heterogeneity in agents' responses

 However,
 a question remains open in this class of competitive-search models:
 How does inflation affect the trade-off underlying heterogenous individuals' matching and market participation rates,
 their corresponding terms of trade,
 and the resulting equilibrium distribution of agents' money holdings?
 This question is very relevant now as most advanced economies are facing higher inflation rates in recent times.

\begin_layout Standard
In our model,
 individuals direct their search to sellers,
 and sellers post their trade terms in anticipation of different matching probabilities at different trading posts (or submarkets).
 These incentives and matching probabilities,
 in turn,
 depend on different levels of money holdings and inflation policy.
 This introduces a different channel of monetary policy that is muted in models without this endogenous mechanism.
 Consequently,
 we have equilibrium-determined distributions of market participation,
 market tightness,
 relative prices,
 and trade quantities.

 We emphasize that with a non-degenerate distribution of money balances in equilibrium,
 the effects of inflation on these trade-offs in our model depend on agents' money holdings.
 We provide a numerical comparative study of steady-state equilibria across two inflation regimes to illustrate the results (see Section

 When we consider the unconditional distribution of all agents,

This translates to an increase in dispersion of total payments and trading probabilities as inflation becomes higher.

\begin_layout Standard
Higher inflation has two effects on agents' money holdings.
 On one hand,
 higher inflation tends to compress dispersion in money holding.
 That comes from the intensive margin effect.
 This is typically known as the redistributive effect of the inflation tax and is a common feature in all heterogeneous-agent monetary models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
before "see,  for example,"
key "erosa-ventura-2002-jme"

\end_inset

.
 On the other hand,
 with higher inflation,
 the extensive margin aspect of competitive search gives us a rising dispersion in heterogeneous matching opportunities,
 spending amounts,
 and speeds of transactions.
 These gaps between the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

poor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 widen with inflation and deliver an opposing force against the standard redistributive effect of inflation tax.
 When inflation is low,
 the intensive margin effect dominates,
 while the extensive margin effect becomes stronger at sufficiently high inflation rates.
 This leads to a novel non-monotonic relationship between inflation and money-holding inequality:
 For low long-run inflation rates,
 the inequality in money holdings tends to diminish with inflation.
 However,
 for sufficiently high inflation rates,
 the inequality in money holdings increases with inflation.

In this paper,
 we focus our analysis on inflationary regimes within the standard range studied in the literature and experienced in most industrialized countries in the more recent decades.
 We do not consider inflation tending to the hyperinflationary direction.
 In such cases,
 the distribution will compress as the extreme tax will eventually make money valueless.
 We have verified this in our computations but do not focus on this in the paper.

\begin_layout Standard
As a consequence of this friction working against the compressing or redistributive effect of inflation,
 the welfare cost of inflation is nontrivial,
 especially when transitional dynamics are taken into account.
 In standard models,
 due to its redistributive property,
 the welfare cost of inflation is lowered relative to a representative-agent monetary model.
 With competitive search,
 this effect can be dominated by the effects of inflation on the extensive margin of trade.
 As a result,
 we find that the welfare cost of inflation can be as high as,
 or even higher than,
 the original representative-agent calculation of

Finally,
 we also develop a novel way of solving the equilibrium computationally.
 There is a technical challenge posed by the theoretical work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

:
 The agents' ex-ante value function (labelled as 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 later) induced by pure strategies with competitive search is typically non-concave/convex over multiple parts of its domain ( money holdings).
 Thus,
 agents can be better off by choosing lotteries that convexify the graph of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 We propose a practical,
 efficient,
 and high-precision implementation of this idea using standard convex hull computational tools.

 did compute inflationary equilibria in their one-shot version of a competitive search market.
 However,
 they only have one lottery segment,
 or that the authors seemed to have only checked for or found just one in their setup.
 Generically,
 there may be more.
 Our method,
 which does not presume this and does not discretize the target value function,
 is more accurate and can find more than one possible lottery.
 As far as we know,
 this is a first in this literature,
 although similar computational strategies have been used in computational dynamic games

 First,
 inflation acts as an intertemporal tax that distorts consumption.
 This feature raises the (welfare) cost of inflation in all monetary models (with or without heterogeneous agents).
 Second,
 inflation is costly since agents have to engage in precautionary liquidity management activities.

 inflation may act as a redistributive tax that shifts resources from the

 That is,
 with higher inflation,
 agents would like to reduce their money holdings.
 Those with high money balances reduce their holdings more relative to those at the bottom end of the distribution.
 This tends to lower the average money balance.
 Hence,
 inflation acts as a progressive tax that reduces inequality of money holdings.
 This explains why in many heterogeneous-agent models,
 the welfare cost of inflation is often smaller than representative-agent models

 There is a similar effect in our model,
 but with a different underlying twist.
 In our setting with competitive search in decentralized trades,
 this is bolstered by the additional extensive margin effect:
 Higher inflation exacts a greater downside risk of not matching for agents by reducing the equilibrium matching probability for buyers.
 Although expected money carried in each decentralized trade will be lower per payment for goods,
 with lower equilibrium probability of matching,
 agents who get matched don't have to reduce consumption as much.
 This trade-off between matching probability and quantity of goods in the competitive search environment

 In their setting,
 agents can only hold indivisible amounts of money.
 Furthermore,
 the inflation policy in their framework is indirectly determined through an abstract fiscal tax-and-transfer scheme that is conditioned on individual wealth.
 In our setting,
 we take the anonymity of agents literally and do not presume that government policy has such superior informational advantage.
 Moreover,

 This allows the models to be more amenable to empirical calibration and quantitative work.

 This means that agents' decision problems are recursively independent of the equilibrium distribution of assets.
 This has an accuracy benefit in practical computation—

 The essence of their model is as follows:
 Suppose all agents begin in the economy as identical individuals.
 In one period,
 each agent has to make a decision whether to enter a centralized market (CM) to work and re-balance their money holdings,
 or to direct their search in a decentralized market (DM).
 In the search problem agents direct themselves to different trading posts with different terms of trade and matching probabilities.
 Firms anticipate that and create these trading posts accordingly.
 In equilibrium,
 there is an asymptotic distribution of heterogenous money holdings that must be consistent with the agents' different reponses in trading probabilities,
 payments and market participation rates.

 In our model,

 With higher inflation,
 agents are also spending faster in decentralized trades and entering the centralized market to rebalance their liquidity more frequently.
 Higher centralized-market participation implies that there are more agents with less money holding at the end of each period.
 These agents will enter the centralized market in the subsequent period.
 Also,
 there will be a smaller measure of agents at the upper end of the distribution since they top up with less liquidity in the centralized market and spend faster in the decentralized search market.

 What is different here is that the endogenous matching probabilities are heterogeneous in agent states and its distribution depends on inflation.
 This creates a nontrivial equilibrium,

 This is an important feature driving our non-monotone inequality results.

Two features of the model give rise to market incompleteness:
 First,
 equilibrium matching in the DM (where money is essential) implies that agents face ex-ante uncertainty over being able to exchange and consume in those markets.
 Second,
 in the equilibria that emerge,
 there is endogenous limited participation in centralized markets.
 Since agents are anonymous in the DM,
 their individual risks are uninsurable:
 private state-contingent securities are not incentive feasible.
 Anonymity renders equilibrium value for money as a medium of exchange.

Note that the firms' problem above (and also agents' decision problems to be discussed below) do not explicitly depend on the aggregate distribution of agents.
 This is because of the nature of competitive search in the DM:
 Firms and buyers take matching probabilities as given when making their respective price posting and directed search decisions.
 The observed terms of trade posts and matching probabilities suffice to condition their decision processes.
 Moreover,
 CM preferences are quasilinear such that agents are identical at the end of the CM.

 argument:
 Suppose there is some exogenous perturbation that induces an infinitesimally small measure of buyers to show up in every submarket.

 we can deduce that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
s(x,q)\equiv\mu\circ b\left(x,q\right)=\begin{cases}
\frac{k}{x-c(q)} & \iff x-c(q)>k\\

Observe that the firm's probability of matching with a buyer,
 
\begin_inset Formula $s(x,q):=\rho\left(\theta\left(x,q\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 depends only on the posted terms of trade 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,q)$

 Likewise,
 the buyer's probability of matching with a firm is 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $b(x,q):=\lambda\left(\theta\left(x,q\right)\right)$

\series default
,
 for a given the matching technology 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,1]$
\end_inset

 Thus,
 in any submarket with positive measure of buyers,
 the market tightness,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta(x,q)\equiv b(x,q)/s(x,q)$

 is neccessarily and sufficiently determined by free entry into the submarket.
 Moreover,
 the terms of trade of a submarket 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,q)$

 is sufficient to identify the submarket.
 This implies that firms' and agents' optimal decision processes do not depend on the equilibrium distribution of agents.
 They only depend on the distribution through the aggregate statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 as a result of inflation.
 The equilibrium will be (partially) block recursive.

 The proof is given in the appendix,

 Part 1 of the proposition states that

 This observation uses standard results from optimization and is contained in Lemma

 of the appendix.
 Part 2 is proven in Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lem:DM B no trade region"

\end_inset

 in the appendix,
 and its insight here is simple:
 If buyers do not carry enough money to at least pay for a trading post's fixed cost,
 no firm will want to set up that post in equilibrium,
 and so the buyers get nothing.
 Part 3(a) is proven in Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lem:DM policies unique, increasing, continuous at m"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 using the fact that a log-transform of a DM buyer's objective function is jointly concave in the choice variables

 and is continuous in 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 (fixing the aggregate state 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 It nevertheless satisfies an increasing difference—
and therefore,
 supermodularity—

 Thus,
 by lattice programming arguments,
 we can show that the DM buyer's optimal policies are increasing in

Whether a SME is unique remains elusive to us as the frequency function 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{d}G(m;\omega)$
\end_inset

 does not admit a closed form expression in terms of known functions,
 and in general,
 it will also depend on the equilibrium candidate 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 This statement is also true for the original

 setting,
 if the authors' model had money supply growth.
 With money supply growth,
 the authors cannot derive analytically how long it will take for DM-unmatched buyers' balances to get eroded by inflation before they have to go to work again.
 This makes their version of the frequency function 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{d}G(m;\omega)$
\end_inset

 with money supply growth not tractable.
 In contrast,
 the variation in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 admits an analytical form for 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{d}G(m;\omega)$
\end_inset

 and as a result they can show that there is a unique SME.
 This special result arises from their assumption that all types of agents in the DM must deterministically enter the CM 
\emph on
after one round 
\emph default
of trade (or no trade) in the DM.
 In their model,
 without an exogenous distribution of CM preference shocks,
 given the market timing assumptions,
 there would be no distribution of agents since preferences are quasilinear in their CM.

Recall that the directed search problem makes the value function

\begin_inset Formula $\left(\cdot,\omega\right)$

 non-concave.
 Since there may exist lotteries that make agents better off than playing pure strategies over participating in DM or CM,
 we have to devise a means for finding these lotteries that convexify the graph of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

.
 A common way to do this is to discretize the function's original domain of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Then,
 around each finite element of the domain,
 one must check if there is a linear segment that 
\emph on
approximately
\emph default
 convexifies 
\begin_inset Formula $graph\left[\tilde{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)\right]$
\end_inset

 This is prone to compounded errors,
 especially if the grid is coarse.

Our computational contribution exploits the insight that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 has a bounded and convex domain,
 thus there exists a smallest convex set that contains its graph.
 This set is indeed 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{graph}\left[\bar{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)\right]$

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{graph}\left[\bar{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Given these points,
 we approximate the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 by interpolation on a chosen continuous basis function.
 We use the family of shape-preserving,
 linear B-splines.
 With this algorithm,
 we can very quickly and directly determine the entire set of possible lotteries that exists with an arbitrarily high precision,
 for any given non-convex/concave function

 Let

 denote the number of buyers,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

 the number of sellers at a trading post and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$

 the number of matches that has occurred.
 A buyer's matching probability is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $b=v/\mathscr{B}$
\end_inset

,
 while a seller's matching probability is 
\begin_inset Formula $s=v/\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

 This implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{B}/\mathscr{S}=s/b$

 The number of matches in a telephone-line matching function is given by

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho>0$

 From these,
 we can derive the relationship:
 
\begin_inset Formula $s\equiv\mu\left(b\right)=\left(1-b^{\rho}\right)^{1/\rho}$

 In our robustness checks,
 we found that our results do not change qualitatively with

 At a given inflation rate,
 the higher money-balance (

 With higher inflation,

 the average outcome of DM speed of transactions become higher.
 (This finding is further reinforced by the observation that the top-10% of DM agents trade faster relative to the bottom-10% as inflation rise.

The previous discussion centers on equilibrium decision or allocation functions,

On average,
 agents end up paying less and matching at lower rates as inflation becomes higher.
 However,
 the decline of these outcomes with inflation is flatter for the ``rich'' agents than the ``poor'' agents.
 This induces the distribution of payments and matching risk in the DM to widen or be more dispersed.

Another way to see the increased dominance of the extensive or trading-opportunity margin as inflation rises is as follows.
 Consider Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Agents-trade-faster"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 Since the probability of not getting matched,
 
\begin_inset Formula $1-b^{\star}\left(m\right)$
\end_inset

,
 increases with inflation for all agents in the DM,
 this exacerbates the cost of holding money for DM buyers who are unmatched,
 especially those holding higher money balances.
 We observe that across the distribution of agents,
 matching probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{\star}\left(m\right)$
\end_inset

 decrease with inflation.
 However,
 what matters for DM agents is how quickly they can dispose of a given amount of liquidity they carry into each DM round to exchange for DM goods.
 Above,
 we introduced a useful summary statistic:
 the (average) payment in the DM across buyers,
 
\begin_inset Formula $bx$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 This ratio increases with inflation.
 This means that within the DM-conditional distribution,
 the dispersions in matching rates,
 payments,
 and transaction velocities increase with inflation,
 with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rich
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 agents facing a less steep decline in these outcomes than the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

poor
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 agents.
 This symptom is the consequence of what we outlined above regarding the dominance of the DM extensive margin as inflation rises.

In summary,
 the extensive margin effect creates more dispersion in the matching,

 This tends to work against the redistributive or compression effect of inflation.
 For low inflation,
 the latter dominates and for higher inflation,
 the former takes over.

 (which has additional bargaining frictions),
 the comparative-steady-state welfare cost of inflation can be quite high.
 However,
 this welfare cost tends to be lower when one revisits the question in a heterogeneous-agent version of the models.
 It is well known that the redistributive margin of inflation tax is always present in heterogeneous-agent models.
 This margin tends to reduce the inefficiency of holding money in the presence of inflation

\begin_layout Standard
How inflation drives trading-probability and spending intensity trade-off of individuals in heterogeneous-agent search models remained an open question.
 In such a setting due to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet*
key "menzio-shi-sun2012-jet"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 we study the effect of long-run inflation on welfare and money-holdings inequality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We show that the endogenous trade-off between these intensive and extensive margins culminate in a non-monotone effect of inflation on money-holdings inequality.
 The effect of inflation tax on liquid-wealth inequality is also non-monotone.
 Thus,
 the welfare cost of inflation in our model is sizable,
 despite the redistributive effect of inflation that tends to induce heterogenous-agent monetary models to produce lower costs of inflation,
 relative to their representative-agent counterparts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper,
 we focus on a single-asset,
 pure-currency economy in order to have a simple and clear understanding of the the effect of inflation on equilibrium extensive- and intensive-margins of trade-off of individuals and its distributional consequence.
 We think that if we allowed agents to hold additional illiquid assets (say,
 in the centralized markets),
 this may further exarcerbate the inequality result in our model.
 We are currently exploring this conjecture in an expanded setting with liquid and illiquid assets,
 and,
 further with aggregate dynamics.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Since the framework renders agents' Markov decision processes independent from the aggregate distribution,
 but for an aggregate scalar statistic,
 we will have an exact 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "krusell-smith1998-jpe"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 sort of algorithm for computing equilibria.
 This is especially pertinent for the extended setting with aggregate dynamics,
 as the competitive search refinement means that the solution method can be made more efficient and more precise,
 than models where one has to brute-force approximate distributions when solving agent problems.

Consider the feasible choice set for CM saving,
 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

:
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}$
\end_inset

 is an upper bound on end-of-period balance plus transfer (measured in units of labor),
 then this gives the bounds on end-of-period money balance plus transfer,
 in current money value,
 as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau M\leq\omega My+\tau M\leq\omega M\bar{m},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega M$
\end_inset

 is current nominal wage.
 Since there is inflation in nominal wage,
 then next-period initial balance is current end-of-period nominal money balance normalized by the next period nominal wage 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{+1}\omega_{+1}$
\end_inset

,
 
\emph on

\]

\end_inset

Using 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 we can re-write the above bounds as

 Assuming

 this permits an agent to accumulate real balances at the end of each period beyond the level of optimal CM consumption

 Consider the individual's problem beginning in the CM

 Since

 the budget constraint always binds.
 Thus we can re-write

\begin_inset Formula

 and moreover,

 This implies that the value function

 First,
 we make the following observations:
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 is strictly concave in 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

,
 the objective function is strictly concave in 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover,
 the objective function on the RHS of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CM Bellman-1"

\end_inset

 is continuously differentiable with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 The optimal decision,
 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 satisfies the following Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U_{1}\left(C\right)\begin{cases}
=p, & C>0\\
<p, & C=0
\end{cases}.\label{eq:CM KKT c}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In an equilibrium,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p>0$
\end_inset

 will be finite—
in fact,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)\equiv\bar{C}^{\star}=\left(U_{1}\right)^{-1}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

 is a finite and non-negative constant.
 Thus,
 we only have to verify that the optimal decision correspondence,
 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{c}^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)\equiv p\bar{C}^{\star}+y_{c}^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)-m$
\end_inset

 at each 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(m,\omega\right)$

 exists and is at least a compact-valued and upper-semicontinuous (

 the objective function on the RHS of

 is continuous and concave on the compact choice set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,\bar{m}\right]\ni y$

 By Berge's Maximum Theorem,
 the maximizer 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{c}^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)$

 is compact-valued and

 (After we further establish that the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}\left(\cdot,\omega_{+1}\right)$
\end_inset

 exists,
 we show below that it is constant and single-valued with respect to

\begin_layout Proof
Second,
 we take a detour and show that the derivative

 This will be used later to characterize a first-order condition with the respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $y$

 The results below relies on the observation that since 
\begin_inset Formula $V$

\begin_inset Formula $\left(\cdot,\omega_{+1}\right)$
\end_inset

 is a concave,
 real-valued function on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$

 then for all

 there exists a selection

 feasible to a CM agent

 Similarly,
 there is a

 for an agent at

\begin_inset Formula

\end{multline*}

\end_inset

Rearranging these inequalities,
 we have the following fact:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
\frac{Z\left[m,y^{\star}\left(m-\varepsilon,\omega\right)\right]-Z\left[m-\varepsilon,y^{\star}\left(m-\varepsilon,\omega\right)\right]}{m-\left(m-\varepsilon\right)}\\
\leq\frac{W\left(m,\omega\right)-W\left(m-\varepsilon,\omega\right)}{m-\left(m-\varepsilon\right)}\leq\frac{Z\left[m,y^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)\right]-Z\left[m-\varepsilon,y^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)\right]}{m-\left(m-\varepsilon\right)},
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

which,
 after simplifying the denominator and taking limits,
 yields:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
\lim_{\varepsilon\searrow0}\left\{ \frac{Z\left[m,y^{\star}\left(m-\varepsilon,\omega\right)\right]-Z\left[m-\varepsilon,y^{\star}\left(m-\varepsilon,\omega\right)\right]}{\varepsilon}\right\} \\

\iff\\
\beta\lim_{\varepsilon\searrow0}\left\{ \frac{\bar{V}\left[\frac{\omega\left(m+l^{\star}\left(m-\varepsilon,\omega\right)-\bar{C}^{\star}\right)+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right]-\bar{V}\left[\frac{\omega\left(m-\varepsilon+l^{\star}\left(m-\varepsilon,\omega\right)-\bar{C}^{\star}\right)+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right]}{\varepsilon}\right\} \leq W_{1}\left(m,\omega\right)\\

\begin_inset Formula $W\left(\cdot,\omega\right)$

\end_inset

,
 the second term in the inequalities above is equal to the partial derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{1}\left(m,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

,
 which is constant.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\searrow0$
\end_inset

,
 there is a selection 
\begin_inset Formula $l^{\star}\left(m-\varepsilon,\omega\right)\rightarrow l^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)$

 and,
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 the first is the left derivative of

 Moreover,
 the last term is identical to the first,

\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

Therefore,
 if the optimal selection is interior,
 these weak inequalities must hold with equality,
 so we have the left derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{V}$
\end_inset

 with respect to the agent's decision variable 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\beta}{1+\tau}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{+1}}\right)\bar{V}_{1}\left[\frac{\omega y^{\star-}\left(m,\omega\right)+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right]=W_{1}\left(m,\omega\right).
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{\star-}\left(m,\omega\right)\equiv m^{-}+l^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)-\bar{C}^{\star}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
By similar arguments,
 we can also prove that the right directional derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{V}\left(\cdot,\omega_{+1}\right)$
\end_inset

 exists,
 and show that the right derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{V}$
\end_inset

 with respect to the agents decision 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\beta}{1+\tau}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{+1}}\right)\bar{V}_{1}\left[\frac{\omega y^{\star+}\left(m,\omega\right)+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right]=W_{1}\left(m,\omega\right),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{\star+}\left(m,\omega\right)\equiv m^{+}+l^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)-\bar{C}^{\star}$
\end_inset

.
 From the last two equations,
 we can conclude that the right and left directional derivatives must agree,
 and thus,
 we have the first-order KKT condition as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\beta}{1+\tau}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{+1}}\right)\bar{V}_{1}\left(\frac{\omega y^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)\begin{cases}
\leq1, & y^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)\geq0\\
\geq1, & y^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)\leq y_{\max}\left(\omega;\tau\right)
\end{cases},
\]

\end_inset

where the weak inequalities apply with complementary slackness.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{V}$
\end_inset

 is strictly concave,
 the condition above ensures a unique selection 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 at each state.

 note that in the previous proof of Part

\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 will always be interior.
 Evaluating the budget constraint in terms of optimal choices at the current individual state 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
l^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)=\bar{y}^{\star}\left(\omega\right)-m+\bar{C}^{\star}.
\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $m\in\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 then,
 the minimal 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 attains when 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is maximal at 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}$
\end_inset

,
 and,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{y}^{\star}\left(\bar{m},\omega\right)=0$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
l_{\min}: & =\check{l}^{\star}\left(\bar{m},\omega\right)\equiv0-\bar{m}+\bar{C}^{\star}>0.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The last inequality obtains from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Assumption-bounds on l and m"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 which requires 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}<U^{-1}\left(1\right)$
\end_inset

,
 and from optimal CM consumption 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CM optimal C*"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 which yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
C^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right) & \equiv\bar{C}^{\star}=\left(U_{1}\right)^{-1}\left(1\right),\label{eq:CM optimal C*}
\end{align}

\end_inset

a finite and non-negative constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The maximal 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 attains when 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{y}^{\star}\left(0,\omega\right)=y_{\text{max }}\left(\omega;\tau\right)$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
l_{\text{max}}\left(\omega,\tau\right):=y_{\text{max }}\left(\omega;\tau\right)-0+\bar{C}^{\star}=y_{\text{max}}\left(\omega;\tau\right)+U^{-1}\left(1\right)<2U^{-1}\left(1\right).\label{eq:lmax}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Clearly,
 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{\text{max}}\left(\omega,\tau\right)<+\infty$
\end_inset

.
 If we do not have hyperinflation,
 or,
 if transfers are not excessively large—

\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
,
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau/\omega<\bar{m}$
\end_inset

—
then,
 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{\text{max}}\left(\omega,\tau\right)>0$
\end_inset

 will be well-defined.
 So if 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau/\omega<\bar{m}$
\end_inset

,
 then we will have an interior optimizer for all 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

:
 
\begin_inset Formula $0<l_{\min}\leq l^{\star}\left(m\right)\leq l_{\text{max}}\left(\omega;\tau\right)<+\infty.$

\begin_inset Formula

 we have re-defined the composite function

 DM buyers' optimal decisions are such that

\begin_layout Proof
Since a buyer's payment 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is always constrained above by her initial money balance 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 in the DM,
 it will never be optimal for any firm to trade with such a buyer whose 
\begin_inset Formula $m\leq k$
\end_inset

,
 as the firm will be making an economic loss.
 In equilibrium it is thus optimal for a buyer 
\begin_inset Formula $m\leq k$
\end_inset

 to optimally not trade and exit the DM with end-of-period balance as 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 (
\emph on
i.e.

,
 with beginning-of-next-period balance 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(m,\omega)$

 As a result,
 the continuation value is 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{V}\left[\phi(m,\omega),\omega_{+1}\right]$

 and thus,
 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(m,\omega\right)=\beta\bar{V}\left[\phi(m,\omega),\omega_{+1}\right]$

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The main difference is in the details underlying the buyer's continuation value function,
 which in our setting is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Nevertheless,
 we still have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)\in\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

 As a consequence the proof of Lemma 3.3 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "menzio-shi-sun2012-jet"

\end_inset

 can be adapted to our setting.
 For the reader's convenience,
 we repeat the proof strategy of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 below for our model setting in a few steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The DM buyer's problem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:DM Bellman (x,b)"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 can be re-written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B(\mathbf{s})=\beta\bar{V}\left(\phi(m,\omega),\omega_{+1}\right)+\exp\left\{ \max_{x\in[0,m],b\in[0,1]}\left\{ \ln\left(b\right)+\ln\left[R\left(x,b;m,\omega\right)\right]\right\} \right\} .
\]

\end_inset

The optimizers thus must satisfy
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
(x^{\star},b^{\star})(m,\omega)\in\left\{ \arg\max_{x\in[0,m],b\in[0,1]}\left\{ \ln\left(b\right)+\ln\left[R\left(x,b;m,\omega,\omega_{+}\right)\right]\right\} \right\} .\label{eq:(x,b) DM optimum}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

(
\emph on
Uniqueness and continuity of policies
\emph default
.) First we establish that the policy functions are continuous,
 and,
 at every state,
 there is a unique optimal selection:
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{Q}\left(x,b\right)$
\end_inset

 is continuous,
 jointly and strictly concave in 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,b)$
\end_inset

,
 and by assumption,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)\in\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right],$
\end_inset

 then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\left(x,b;m,\omega\right)\equiv u^{Q}(x,b)+\beta\bar{V}\left(\phi^{\star}(m,\omega),\omega_{+1}\right)-\beta\bar{V}\left(\phi(m,\omega),\omega_{+1}\right)
\]

\end_inset

is continuous,
 jointly and strictly concave in the choice variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,b\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Also,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(b)$
\end_inset

 is strictly increasing and strictly concave in 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the maximand is jointly and strictly concave in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,b\right)$

 is an optimal policy satisfying 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 then under action

 we must have that
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 then under

\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

Re-write the two inequalities above as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
\frac{K_{\omega}\left[a+\varepsilon,\tilde{\varphi}(a,\omega)\right]-K_{\omega}\left[a,\tilde{\varphi}(a,\omega)\right]}{\varepsilon}\leq\frac{J\left(a+\varepsilon,\omega\right)-J\left(a,\omega\right)}{\varepsilon}\\

—
and therefore the objective function in

\begin_inset Formula $J_{1}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)$

 Therefore,
 the right derivative of this value function must agree with its partial derivative:
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{\varepsilon\searrow0}J\left(a+\varepsilon,\omega\right)=J_{1}\left(a,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Using this fact,
 the inequalities above imply
\begin_inset Formula

Moreover,
 by continuity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\varphi}(\cdot,\omega)$
\end_inset

,
 we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{\varepsilon\searrow0}\tilde{\varphi}(a+\varepsilon,\omega)=\tilde{\varphi}(a,\omega)$
\end_inset

,
 so the inequalities above collapse to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
u^{\prime}\left[\tilde{q}(a^{+},\omega)\right]:=\lim_{\varepsilon\searrow0}\frac{u^{C}\left(a+\varepsilon-\tilde{\varphi}(a,\omega)\right)-u^{C}\left(a-\tilde{\varphi}(a,\omega)\right)}{\varepsilon}\leq J_{1}\left(a,\omega\right)\\
\leq\lim_{\varepsilon\searrow0}\frac{u^{C}\left(a+\varepsilon-\tilde{\varphi}(a,\omega)\right)-u^{C}\left(a-\tilde{\varphi}(a,\omega)\right)}{\varepsilon}=:u^{\prime}\left[\tilde{q}(a^{+},\omega)\right].
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

However,
 the first and the last term in the inequalities above are identical,
 and they are the same as the right derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $q:=\tilde{q}(a,\omega)$
\end_inset

,
 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
,
 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\prime}\left[\tilde{q}(a^{+},\omega)\right].$
\end_inset

 Thus,
 it must be that 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\prime}\left[\tilde{q}(a^{+},\omega)\right]=J_{1}\left(a,\omega\right).$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Using similar arguments as above,
 we can also consider the left-hand-side perturbation about 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

,
 to evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\varphi}(a-\varepsilon,\omega)$
\end_inset

.
 It can be shown that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
u^{\prime}\left[\tilde{q}(a^{-},\omega)\right]:=\lim_{\varepsilon\searrow0}\frac{u^{C}\left(a-\varepsilon-\tilde{\varphi}(a,\omega)\right)-u^{C}\left(a-\tilde{\varphi}(a,\omega)\right)}{\varepsilon}\leq J_{1}\left(a,\omega\right)\\
\leq\lim_{\varepsilon\searrow0}\frac{u^{C}\left(a-\varepsilon-\tilde{\varphi}(a,\omega)\right)-u^{C}\left(a-\tilde{\varphi}(a,\omega)\right)}{\varepsilon}=:u^{\prime}\left[\tilde{q}(a^{-},\omega)\right],
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\prime}\left[\tilde{q}(a^{-},\omega)\right]=J_{1}\left(a,\omega\right).$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Combining the two arguments above,
 we have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u'\left[\tilde{q}(a,\omega)\right]=u^{\prime}\left[\tilde{q}(a^{+},\omega)\right]=u^{\prime}\left[\tilde{q}(a^{-},\omega)\right]=J_{1}\left(a,\omega\right)>0.
\]

\end_inset

Finally,
 the equivalence 
\begin_inset Formula $u'\left[\tilde{q}(a,\omega)\right]=\left(u^{Q}\right)_{1}\left[x^{\star}(m,\omega),b^{\star}(m,\omega)\right]$
\end_inset

 can be derived using standard calculus,
 since the composite function 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{Q}\equiv u\circ Q$
\end_inset

 is a known continuously differentiable function in its arguments 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,b)$
\end_inset

.
 The assumption on 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 that marginal utility is everywhere positive renders 
\begin_inset Formula $u'\left[\tilde{q}(a,\omega)\right]>0$
\end_inset

.
 This completes the proof of the claim.

\begin_layout Proof
Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{q}(a,\omega)$
\end_inset

 is increasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Since we have shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $u'\left[\tilde{q}(a,\omega)\right]=J_{1}\left(a,\omega\right)>0$
\end_inset

,
 then 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{1}\left(a,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 is also decreasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $J\left(a,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 is clearly increasing in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

,
 then we conclude that it is also concave in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 The term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu^{-1}\left(\frac{k}{m-a}\right)$
\end_inset

 is strictly decreasing and strictly concave in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the objective function in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 is strictly concave in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$

 Thus maximizing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

nolink "false"

\end_inset

 over 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 yields a unique optimal selection 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\star}(m,\omega)$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover,
 the objective function in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

nolink "false"

\end_inset

 is continuously differentiable with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

;
 and using 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:J'(a) = u1(x,b)"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 we can show that 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\star}(m,\omega)$
\end_inset

 satisfies the first-order condition:
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\mu^{-1}\left(\frac{k}{m-a}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The term 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{d}b/\text{d}a=k/\left(m-a\right)^{2}\times1/\mu'\left[b\right]$
\end_inset

 can be derived using the implicit function theorem:
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $H(a,b)=k/\left(m-a\right)-\mu\left[b\right]=0.$
\end_inset

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{d}b/\text{d}a=-H_{a}(a,b)/H_{b}(a,b)$
\end_inset

,
 which yields the result.
 The first-order condition is thus derived as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
\left[J\left(a^{\star}(m,\omega),\omega\right)-\beta\bar{V}\left(\frac{\omega m+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)\right]\frac{k}{\left(m-a^{\star}(m,\omega)\right)^{2}}\frac{1}{\mu'\left[b^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)\right]}\\

<0, & \text{if }a^{\star}(m,\omega)=m-k
\end{cases}.
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

Moreover,
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $k/(m-a)=\mu(b)$
\end_inset

 we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{d}b/\text{d}a=k/\left(m-a\right)^{2}\times1/\mu'\left[b\right]\equiv\left[\mu\left(b\right)\right]^{2}/k\times1/\mu'\left[b\right]$

 and using the relation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 the first-order condition can be further simplified to

Observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)>0$

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\star}(m,\omega)$
\end_inset

 is continuous in 
\begin_inset Formula $m$

 then there is an

 the selection 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\star}\left(m',\omega\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $m'$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Given that 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 is optimal for agent 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

,
 and since 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi^{\star}\text{\left(m,\omega\right)}=\tilde{\varphi}\left[a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)\right]$
\end_inset

,
 then we have the buyer's optimal value as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
B(m,\omega) & =\beta\bar{V}\left(\frac{\omega m+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)+\max_{a\in\left[0,m-k\right],\varphi\geq0}\left\{ \mu^{-1}\left(\frac{k}{m-a}\right)\right.\\
 & \left.\ \ \ \times\left[u\circ c^{-1}\left(a-\varphi\right)\right.+\beta\bar{V}\left(\frac{\omega\tilde{\varphi}+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)-\beta\bar{V}\left(\frac{\omega m+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)\right\} \\
 & =F\left(a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right),m\right)\geq F\left(a^{\star}\left(m+\epsilon,\omega\right),m\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F\left(a,m\right):=\beta\bar{V}\left(\frac{\omega m+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)+\mu^{-1}\left(\frac{k}{m-a}\right)\left[J\left(a,\omega\right)-\beta\bar{V}\left(\frac{\omega m+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly,
 for agent 
\begin_inset Formula $m+\epsilon$
\end_inset

,
 it must be that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B\left(m+\epsilon,\omega\right)=F\left(a^{\star}\left(m+\epsilon,\omega\right),m+\epsilon\right)\geq F\left(a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right),m+\epsilon\right).
\]

\end_inset

Clearly,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
\frac{F\left(a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right),m+\epsilon\right)-F\left(a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right),m\right)}{\epsilon}\leq\frac{B\left(m+\epsilon,\omega\right)-B\left(m,\omega\right)}{\epsilon}\\
\leq\frac{F\left(a^{\star}\left(m+\epsilon,\omega\right),m+\epsilon\right)-F\left(a^{\star}\left(m+\epsilon,\omega\right),m\right)}{\epsilon}.
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $F\left(a,m\right)$
\end_inset

 is continuous and concave in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

,
 and,
 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 is continuous in 
\begin_inset Formula $m$

 the following limits exist

 and the inequality ordering is preserved in the limit:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
\lim_{\epsilon\searrow0}\frac{F\left(a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right),m+\epsilon\right)-F\left(a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right),m\right)}{\epsilon}\leq\lim_{\epsilon\searrow0}\frac{B\left(m+\epsilon,\omega\right)-B\left(m,\omega\right)}{\epsilon}\\
\leq\lim_{\epsilon\searrow0}\frac{F\left(a^{\star}\left(m+\epsilon,\omega\right),m+\epsilon\right)-F\left(a^{\star}\left(m+\epsilon,\omega\right),m\right)}{\epsilon}.
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{\epsilon\searrow0}a^{\star}\left(m+\epsilon,\omega\right)=a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

,
 the inequalities above are equivalent to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
b^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)\left[J_{1}\left(a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right),\omega\right)-\frac{\beta}{1+\tau}\bar{V}_{1}\left(\frac{\omega m^{+}+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)\right]\\

\qquad\qquad\leq b^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)\left[J_{1}\left(a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right),\omega\right)-\frac{\beta}{1+\tau}\bar{V}_{1}\left(\frac{\omega m^{+}+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)\right]\\
+\frac{\beta}{1+\tau}\bar{V}_{1}\left(\frac{\omega m^{+}+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right),
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
\bar{V}_{1}\left(\frac{\omega m^{+}+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)\\
:=\lim_{\epsilon\searrow0}\left(1+\tau\right)\left(\frac{\omega_{+1}}{\omega}\right)\left[\bar{V}\left(\frac{\omega\left(m+\epsilon\right)+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)-\bar{V}\left(\frac{\omega m+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)\right]/\epsilon.
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

However,
 observe that the first and the last terms in the inequalities are identical.
 Thus we must have that the right derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(\cdot,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 satisfies
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
B_{1}\left(m^{+},\omega\right)=b^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)\left[J_{1}\left(a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right),\omega\right)-\frac{\beta}{1+\tau}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{+1}}\right)\bar{V}_{1}\left(\frac{\omega m^{+}+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)\right]\\
+\frac{\beta}{1+\tau}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{+1}}\right)\bar{V}_{1}\left(\frac{\omega m^{+}+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right).
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

By a similar process to arrive at the left derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(\cdot,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

,
 we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
B_{1}\left(m^{-},\omega\right)=b^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right)\left[J_{1}\left(a^{\star}\left(m,\omega\right),\omega\right)-\frac{\beta}{1+\tau}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{+1}}\right)\bar{V}_{1}\left(\frac{\omega m^{-}+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)\right]\\
+\frac{\beta}{1+\tau}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{+1}}\right)\bar{V}_{1}\left(\frac{\omega m^{-}+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right),

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
\bar{V}_{1}\left(\frac{\omega m^{-}+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)\\
:=\left(1+\tau\right)\left(\frac{\omega_{+1}}{\omega}\right)\lim_{\epsilon\searrow0}\left\{ \frac{1}{\epsilon}\left[\bar{V}\left(\frac{\omega\left(m-\epsilon\right)+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)-\bar{V}\left(\frac{\omega m+\tau}{\omega_{+1}\left(1+\tau\right)},\omega_{+1}\right)\right]\right\} .

 it is apparent that

Since we assumed

From this ordering,
 we can conclude that if

 if the optimal choice for

\begin_inset Formula $b^{\star}(m,\omega)\in\left(0,1\right)$

From Lemma

Since these marginal valuation functions are evaluated at the DM buyer's optimal choice,
 it must be that 
\begin_inset Formula

Proof of Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

nolink "false"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
First,
 we show that the value functions listed in the definition of a SME are unique given 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 For given 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

,
 The CM agent's problem in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:CM Bellman"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 clearly defines a self-map 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\omega}^{CM}:\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]\rightarrow\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 which preserves monotonicity,
 continuity and concavity (see Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lem:CM value W increasing, concave, continuous, linear"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

).
 However,
 for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

,
 the DM buyer's problem in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:DM Bellman (x,b)"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 defines an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\omega}^{DM}:\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]\rightarrow\mathcal{C}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]\supset\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

 is the set of continuous and increasing functions on the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 This operator does not preserve concavity.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{V}(\cdot,\omega)\in\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

 as previously defined.
 Now we show that the ex-ante problem in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Ex ante value-binary choice"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Ex ante value"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 defines an operator that maps the CM agent's and the DM buyer's value functions,
 respectively,
 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\cdot,\omega)=T_{\omega}^{DM}\bar{V}(\cdot,\omega)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B(\cdot,\omega)=T_{\omega}^{DM}\bar{V}(\cdot,\omega)$
\end_inset

,
 back into the set of continuous,
 increasing and concave functions:
 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\omega}:\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]\rightarrow\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\omega}^{CM}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\omega}^{DM}$
\end_inset

 are monotone functional operators that satisfy discounting with factor 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\beta<1$
\end_inset

,
 then the ex-ante problem in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Ex ante value-binary choice"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Ex ante value"

\end_inset

,
 which defines the composite operator 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\omega}:\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]\rightarrow\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 clearly preserves these two properties.
 (The convexification of the graph of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\omega}$
\end_inset

 via lotteries in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Ex ante value"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 preserves concavity of the image of the operator,
 thus making it a self-map on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

.) It can be shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

 is a complete metric space.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\omega}:\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]\rightarrow\mathcal{V}\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

 satisfies Blackwell's conditions,
 and has a unique fixed point,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)=T_{\omega}\bar{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

,
 by Banach's fixed point theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Second,
 we verify the following three properties:
 (1) By Propositions 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lem:CM value W increasing, concave, continuous, linear"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "thm: DM value and policy functions in SME"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 the agent's optimal policies are continuous,
 single-valued and monotone functions.
 This implies,
 for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

,
 that the Markov kernel 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\mathbf{s},\mathcal{\cdot})$
\end_inset

 in the distributional operator 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:SME Markov map distro"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 is a probability measure,
 and,
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\cdot,E)$
\end_inset

 for all Borel subsets 
\begin_inset Formula $E\in\mathcal{B}\left(\left[0,\bar{m}\right]\right)$
\end_inset

 is a measurable function.
 (2) Since each agent's policies are monotone,
 then 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\mathbf{s},\mathcal{\cdot})$
\end_inset

 is increasing on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the Markov kernel is a transition probability function.
 (3) The equilibrium policies clearly dictate that the monotone mixing conditions of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hopenhayn-prescott1992-ecta"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 are satisfied:
 Consider a DM buyer who has zero money balance.
 With non-zero probability either by pure luck 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\alpha\right)$
\end_inset

 or by choosing a lottery that induces such an outcome,
 he will enter the CM to work and to accumulate some positive money balance.
 Likewise,
 consider an agent,
 either in the DM or CM with the highest possible initial balance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{m}$
\end_inset

.
 Again,
 with non-zero probability,
 she will decumulate that balance,
 either by matching and spending that balance down in the DM,
 or,
 by working less and consuming more in the CM.
 These conditions,
 are sufficient,
 by Theorem 2 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

,
 for the Markov operator 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Thus,
 regardless of an initial distribution of agents,

 This approximation scheme works fine when we only have a lottery where the lower bound in 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{M}_{g}$
\end_inset

 is included,
 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
,
 a lottery on a set like 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ z_{1},z_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{1}=0$
\end_inset

,
 and,
 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{2}<\bar{m}$
\end_inset

.
 It becomes less accurate when lotteries may exist on upper segments of the function,
 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
,
 lotteries on sets like 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ z'_{1},z'_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $0<z'_{1}<z'_{2}<\bar{m}$
\end_inset

,
 but we have no prior knowlege of what 
\begin_inset Formula $z'_{1}$
\end_inset

 is.
 This is because in practice (on the computer) it is not feasible to implement this check which is meant to be done at every element on the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,\bar{m}\right]$
\end_inset

,
 not its approximant 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{M}_{g}$
\end_inset

.
 As a result,
 its implementation on 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{M}_{g}$
\end_inset

 may be prone to introducing non-negligible approximation errors,
 especially when the mesh of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{M}_{g}$
\end_inset

 is coarse.
 Thus,
 one would have to make 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{M}_{g}$
\end_inset

 very fine,
 but,
 this will come at the cost of the overall SME solution time.

Instead,
 we propose a novel alternative here.
 We can exploit the property that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 has a bounded and convex domain,
 so then there exists a smallest convex set that contains 
\begin_inset Formula $g\tilde{V}:=\text{graph}\left[\tilde{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)\right]$
\end_inset

,
 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{conv}\left(g\tilde{V}\right)$

 This set is indeed 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{graph}\left[\bar{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)\right]$

\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{graph}\left[\bar{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Given these points,
 we approximate the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 by interpolation on a chosen continuous basis function.
 We use the family of linear B-splines available from 
\family typewriter
SciPy

 class for this purpose.
 As a residual of this exercise,
 we can very quickly and directly determine the entire set of possible lotteries that exists with minimal loss of precision,
 for any given non-convex/concave function 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{V}\left(\cdot,\omega\right)$

 Here,
 we can see that at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

,
 the agent has his initial real balance as some 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 He decides to be in the DM,
 succeeds in matching with a trading post,
 and spends a fraction of the balance to consume some positive 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 In the following period 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1$
\end_inset

,
 he begins with some positive balance—
because of transfer 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau/(\omega\left(1+\tau\right))>0$
\end_inset

 combined with his residual balance—
but this amount land in the lottery region;
 and so the agents plays the lottery.
 He realizes the high prize of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{2}=0.52$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1$
\end_inset

,
 and so his money balance is 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 He matches and gets to consume 
\begin_inset Formula $q>0$
\end_inset

.
 (Hence,
 the record 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1},x_{1},b_{1}>0$
\end_inset

.) A similar event realizes again in 
\begin_inset Formula $t=2$
\end_inset

,
 so the agent again gets to consume in the DM.
 In 
\begin_inset Formula $t=3$
\end_inset

,
 having spent his balance on consuming in the DM in the previous period,
 the agent realizes a low lottery payoff (
\begin_inset Formula $z_{1}=0$
\end_inset

),
 and his initial balance is thus zero.
 The agent enters the CM,
 works,
 repays the entry cost,
 consumes,
 and saves some money balance.
 That is why we see a record of 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 for the figure panel labelled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 for

 Subsequently in 
\begin_inset Formula $t=4$
\end_inset

,
 he begins again with positive balance from the last CM trade.
 At this point,
 he decides to go shopping in the DM and again,
 spends it all in one round.
 he wins the high prize in the lottery,
 and finds it optimal to enter the CM to work.

 Agents must also pay a fixed cost to enter the CM to load up on money balances.
 Depending on their money balance,
 they may sometimes find it worthwhile to borrow against their CM income to pay the fixed cost of CM entry.
 Thus,
 we have an equilibrium Baumol-Tobin type of money spending cycle in the model.
 Since agents endogenously do not have complete consumption insurance,

We observe that intermediate-level money holders spread out in their masses in Figure

 This explains the additional masses in the intermediate region of the money distribution support.
 The measure of the highest-balance agents go down with inflation as agents work less.
 Additional lotteries can arise as agents in DM expect to trade faster.
 There is less mass in the intermediate

\end_inset

 levels as agents trade faster out of the DM,
 and for agents who choose to enter the CM,
 the additional lottery outcomes push them toward the extreme edges of the high/low prize outcomes.
 This observation is associated with the extensive margin effect so that with higher inflation,
 there can be a higher inequality in

At 0% inflation,
 despite the possibility of different submarkets in the DM,
 it turns out that there is no price dispersion.
 However,
 at 10% inflation,
 there is a marked distribution of pricing outcomes.
